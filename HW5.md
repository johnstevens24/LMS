Homework 5 Cover Sheet
----------------------

In this assignment, I completed:

- [x] Phase 1
- [x] Phase 2
- [x] Phase 3
- [x] Phase 4
- [x] Phase 5

I discussed this assignment with:
-Alyssa Johnson (I just told her to start early because its harder than hw4)

[x] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was customizing the same view to different users. Its really cool that you can have the same HTML file look so different depending on who loads it.

The hardest thing in this assignment was fixing issues that arose because of my code from previous assignments. It was kinda frustrating having things break and realizing it was because my code from a previous homework was causing problems.
