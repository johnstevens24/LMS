[X] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was that html only websites look like crap. They just look boring
and very basic. But they are functional.

The hardest thing in this assignment was trying to guess what the html code was for a website that was being styled with CSS.
Since I don't have experience with CSS, its hard to tell how different the website will look after the CSS is added and
therefore I'm not entirely sure that my html is sufficient. Its got all the words and buttons and what not, but am I missing
html that spaces things out? Or is that part of the CSS?
