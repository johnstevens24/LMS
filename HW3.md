In this assignment, I completed:

- [x] Phase 3

I discussed this assignment with:

- Alyssa Johnson

[x] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was templates are very bare-bones. I guess that makes sense, but I never really thought about i. I think its cool how different you can make two pages look that use the same template.

The hardest thing in this assignment was comprehending this line of phase 5: "The input field should have a name of grade-X where X is the submission's ID and have a value which is the submission's score." For some reason my brain couldn't understand what it was saying and I stared at it for like 20 min, trying to decide if I should make a post on the discord about it or not. Also, getting answers to things on the discord is pretty tough. You have to keep jumping around in the different chats, tryign to see where responses to questions are. I think piazza is a better platform for our purposes.
