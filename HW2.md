Homework 2 Cover Sheet
----------------------

In this assignment, I completed:

- [X] Phase 1
- [X] Phase 2
- [X] Phase 3
- [X] Phase 4
- [X] Phase 5

I discussed this assignment with:

- Alyssa Johnson
- Charly Bueno

[X] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was how to nest tags, classes, and id's. I think its kind of cool to be able to write #loginForm > div > span and have it select some nested item. Kinda fun to play around with...

The hardest thing in this assignment was getting things to center. OH MY LORD I spent probably over half the assignment on phase 5 trying to get things to center, flex-grow, and/or span the whole web page. Sometimes my nav bar wouldn't span the whole page but it the flex-grow div would work. Other times the nav bar would span but the flex-grow dive wouldn't work for some reason. Don't even get me started on trying to get the main content to center while also trying to get my nav bar to span the whole width of the browser.
